    "## Access Data Programmatically\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, you will learn how to programmatically access data using:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Direct downloads / import of data.\n",
    "2. Applied Programming Interfaces (APIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until this point, you have been downloading data from a website (in the case of \n",
    "this course, <a href=\"https://figshare.com/authors/_/3386570\" target=\"_blank\">Figshare</a>) independently. Then, you work with the data in `Python`. The data that you have downloaded are prepared specifically for this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, independently downloading and unzipping data each week is not efficient and does not explicitly tie your\n",
    "data to your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can automate the data download process using `Python`. Automation is particularly useful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You want to download lots of data or particular subsets of data to support an analysis.\n",
    "* There are programmatic ways to access and query the data online.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Link Data Access to Processing & Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "When you automate data access, download, or retrieval, and embed it in your code, \n",
    "you are **directly** linking your analysis to your data. Further, combined with  Jupyter Notebooks, code comments and expressive coding techniques, you are better documenting your workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short - by linking data access and download to your analysis - you are not only reminding your future selves of your process - you are also reminding your future self where (and how) you got the data in the first place! Similarly, this allows your workflow to be easily reproduced by others. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Three Ways to Access Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You can break up programmatic data access into three general categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data that you download by calling a specific URL and using the `Pandas` function `read_table`, which takes in a url.\n",
    "2. Data that you directly import into `Python` using the `Pandas` function `read_csv`.\n",
    "3. Data that you download using an API, which makes a **request** to a data repository and **returns** requested data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Key Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that you access programmatically may be returned in one of two main formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tabular Human-readable file:** Files that are tabular, including CSV files (Comma Separated Values) and even spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel, etc.). These files are organized into columns and rows and are \"flat\" in structure rather than hierarchical.\n",
    "2. **Structured Machine-readable files:** Files that can be stored in a text format but are hierarchical and structured in some way that optimizes machine readability. JSON files are an example of structured machine-readable files.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Data Tip:** There are non-text formatted hierarchical data structures that you will not learn in this module. One example of this is the HDF5 data model (structure).\n",

    "### Download Files Programmatically\n",
    "\n",
    "####  `Pandas` function `read_csv()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can use the `read_csv()` function from `Pandas` to import data directly into `Python` by providing a URL to the CSV file (e.g. `read_csv(URL)`). \n",
    "\n",
    "When you programmatically read data into `Python` using `read_csv()` you are not saving a copy of your data locally, on your computer - you are importing the data directly into `Python`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a copy of that data to use for future analysis without directly importing it, you will need to export the data to your working directory using `write_csv()`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that the data that you downloaded above using are **tabular** and thus **human-readable**. The data are organized into a tabular structure with rows and columns that you can quickly understand. `Python` can import these data into a `Pandas DataFrame` and you can work with it programmatically.\n",

    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "An API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that sits on top of a\n",
    "computer based system and simplifies certain tasks, such as extracting subsets\n",
    "of data from a large repository or database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Web-APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Web APIs allow you to access data available via an internet web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you can access data from web APIs using a URL that contains sets of parameters \n",
    "that specifies the type and particular subset of data that you are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have worked with a database such as `Microsoft SQL Server` or `PostgreSQL`, or if you've ever queried data from a GIS system like ArcGIS, then you can compare the set of parameters associated with a URL string to a SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Web APIs are a way to strip away all the extraneous visual interface that\n",
    "> you don't care about and get the data that you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why You Use Web APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Among other things, APIs allow us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get information that would be time-consuming to get otherwise.\n",
    "* Get information that you can't get otherwise.\n",
    "* Automate an analytical workflows that require continuously updated data.\n",
    "* Access data using a more direct interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Parts of an API Request\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about APIs, it is important to understand two key components: the request and the response. The third part listed below is the intermediate step where the request is PROCESSED by the remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data **REQUEST**: You try to access a `URL` in your browser that specifies a particular subset of data.\n",
    "2. **Data processing:** A web server somewhere uses that url to query a specified dataset.\n",
    "3. Data **RESPONSE**: That web server then sends you back some content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **response** may give you one of two things:\n",
    "1. Some *data* or\n",
    "2. An explanation of why your request *failed*\n",

    "\n",
